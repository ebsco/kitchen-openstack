A [Test Kitchen][kitchen_ci] Driver for [OpenStack][openstack_web].

This driver uses the [fog gem][fog_web] to provision and destroy nova instances. Use an OpenStack cloud for your infrastructure testing!

Shamelessly copied from [Fletcher Nichol](https://github.com/fnichol)'s awesome work on an [EC2 driver](https://github.com/test-kitchen/kitchen-ec2), and [Adam Leff](https://github.com/adamleff)'s amazing work on an [VRO driver](https://github.com/chef-partners/kitchen-vro).

## Requirements

There are **no** external system requirements for this driver. However you will need access to an OpenStack cloud.

## Installation and Setup

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'kitchen-openstack'
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
$ gem install kitchen-openstack
```

Or if using [chefdk][chefdk_dl] install with:

```bash
$ chef gem install kitchen-openstack
```

## Minimum Configuration

```yaml
driver:
  name: openstack
  openstack_username: [YOUR OPENSTACK USERNAME]
  openstack_api_key: [YOUR OPENSTACK API KEY] # AKA your OpenStack Password
  openstack_auth_url: [YOUR OPENSTACK AUTH URL]
  require_chef_omnibus: [e.g. 'true' or a version number if you need Chef]
  image_ref: [SERVER IMAGE ID]
  flavor_ref: [SERVER FLAVOR ID]
transport:
  username: ubuntu # For a Ubuntu Box
```

The `image_ref` and `flavor_ref` options can be specified as an exact id,
an exact name, or as a regular expression matching the name of the image or flavor.

All of Fog's `openstack` options (`openstack_domain_name`, `openstack_project_name`,
...) are supported. This includes support for the OpenStack Identity v3 API.

## General Configuration

### name

**Required** Tell test-kitchen what driver to use. ;)

### openstack\_username

**Required** Your OpenStack username.

### openstack\_api\_key

**Required** Your OpenStack API Key, aka your OpenStack password.

### openstack\_auth\_url

**Required** Your OpenStack auth url.

### require\_chef_omnibus

**Required** Set to `true` otherwise the specific version of Chef omnibus you want installed.

### image\_ref

**Required** Server Image ID.

### flavor\_ref

**Required** Server Flavor ID.

### server\_name

If a `server_name_prefix` is specified then this prefix will be used when
generating random names of the form `<NAME PREFIX>-<RANDOM STRING>` e.g.
`myproject-asdfghjk`. If both `server_name_prefix` and `server_name` are
specified then the `server_name` takes precedence.

### server\_name\_prefix

If you want to have a static prefix for a random server name.

### private\_key\_path

The path to your private ssh key.

### public\_key\_path

The path to your public ssh key.

If a `key_name` is provided it will be used instead of any
`public_key_path` that is specified.

If a `key_name` is provided without any `private_key_path`, unexpected
behavior may result if your local RSA/DSA private key doesn't match that
OpenStack key. If you do key injection via `cloud-init` like this issue:
[#77](https://github.com/test-kitchen/kitchen-openstack/issues/77). The
`key_name` should be a blank string if you need to skip it. Example:

```yml
driver:
  [-- snip --]
  key_name: ""
  user_data: cloud_init
```

### username

**Deprecated** SSH User name, you should be using transport now.

### password

**Deprecated** SSH password, you should be using transport now.

### port

Set the SSH port for the remote access.

### openstack\_tenant

Your OpenStack tenant id.

### openstack\_region

Your OpenStack region id.

### availability\_zone

Your OpenStack availablity zone.

### openstack\_service\_name

Your OpenStack compute service name.

### openstack\_network\_name

Your OpenStack network name used to connect to, if you have only private network
connections you want declare this.

### glance\_cache\_wait\_timeout
When OpenStack downloads the image into cache, it takes extra time to provision.  Timeout controls maximum amount of time to wait for machine to move from the Build/Spawn phase to Active.

### server\_wait

`server_wait` is a workaround to deal with how some VMs with `cloud-init`.
Some clouds need this some, most OpenStack instances don't. This is a stop gap
wait makes sure that the machine is in a good state to work with. Ideally the
transport layer in Test-Kitchen will have a more intelligent way to deal with this.
There will be a dot that appears every 10 seconds as the timer counts down.
You may want to add this for **WinRM** instances due to the multiple restarts that
happen on creation and boot. A good default is `300` seconds to make sure it's
in a good state.

The default is `0`.

### console\_log\_expression

Allows for VMs to execute `cloud-init` or log to the instance console
and not falsely detect the VM as up.  Setting this expression to a regular
expression will block the transport logic until a certain log message
is written.  This allows `cloud-init` to execute any arbitrary script
and wait for it to finish.

The default is `nil`, which is disabled.

### console\_log\_match\_count

How many times to look for `console_log_expression` inside the log.  If
the script is sent in via userdata, the line may show as userdata is
printed once when the script is sent over, and another when executed.

The default is 1

### console\_log\_wait\_timeout

If the `console_log_expression` is defined, how long to wait for the log
messages to show up.  This value is in seconds and is only activated if
`console_log_expression` parameter is defined

The default is 600

### security\_groups

A list of `security_groups` to join:

```yaml
security_groups:
   - [A LIST OF...]
   - [...SECURITY GROUPS TO JOIN]
   ```

### user\_data

If your vms have `cloud-init` enabled you can use the `user_data` in your
kitchen.yml to inject commands at boot time.

```
    driver_config:
      user_data: userdata.txt
```

Then create a `userdata.txt` in the same directory as your .kitchen.yml,
for example:

```
#!/bin/sh
echo "do whatever you want to pre-configure your machine"
```

### network\_ref

**Deprecated** A list of network names or ids to create instances with.

```yaml
network_ref:
   - [OPENSTACK NETWORK NAMES OR...]
   - [...ID TO CREATE INSTANCE WITH]
```

### no\_ssh\_tcp\_check

**Deprecated** You should be using transport now. This will skip the ssh check to automatically connect.

The default is `false`.

### no\_ssh\_tcp\_check\_sleep

**Deprecated** You should be using transport now. This will sleep for so many seconds. `no_ssh_tcp_check` needs
to be set to `true`.

## Disk Configuration

### <a name="config-block_device_mappings"></a> block\_device\_mappings

#### make\_volume

Makes a new volume when set to `true`.

The default is `false`.

#### snapshot\_id

When set, will make a volume from that snapshot id.

#### volume\_id

When set, will attach the volume id.

#### device\_name

Set this to `vda` unless you really know what you are doing.

#### availability\_zone

The block storage availability zone.

The default is `nova`.

#### volume\_type

The volume type, this is optional.

#### delete\_on\_termination

This will delete the volume on the instance when `destroy` happens, if set to true.
Otherwise set this to `false`.

#### creation\_timeout
Timeout to wait for volume to become available.  If a large volume is provisioned, it might take time to provision it on the backend.  Maximum amount of time to wait for volume to be created and be available.

#### Example

```yaml
block_device_mappings:
  make_volume: true
  snapshot_id: 00000-111111-0000222-000
  device_name: vda
  availability_zone: nova
  delete_on_termination: false
  creation_timeout: 120
```

## Network and Communication Configuration

### floating\_ip

A specific `floating_ip` can be provided to bind a floating IP to the node.
Any floating IP will be the IP used for Test Kitchen's Remote calls to the node.

### floating\_ip\_pool

A `floating_ip_pool` can be provided to acquire the first free floating ip from
the pool to attach to the instance. It will be the IP used for Test Kitchen's
Remote calls to the node.

### \[public\|private\]\_ip\_order

In some complex network scenarios you can have several IP addresses designated
as public or private. Use `public_ip_order` or `private_ip_order` to control
which one to use for further SSH connection. Default is 0 (first one)

For example if you have openstack istance that has network with several IPs assigned like

```
+--------------------------------------+------------+--------+------------+-------------+----------------------------------+
| ID                                   | Name       | Status | Task State | Power State | Networks                         |
+--------------------------------------+------------+--------+------------+-------------+----------------------------------+
| 31c98de4-026f-4d12-b03f-a8a35c6e730b | kitchen    | ACTIVE | None       | Running     | test=10.0.0.1, 10.0.1.1   |

```

to use second `10.0.1.1` IP address you need to specify

```yaml
  private_ip_order: 1
```
assuming that test network is configured as private.


### network\_ref

The `network_ref` option can be specified as an exact id, an exact name,
or as a regular expression matching the name of the network. You can pass one

```yaml
  network_ref: MYNET1
```

or many networks

```yaml
network_ref:
  - MYNET1
  - MYNET2
```

The `openstack_network_name` is used to select IP address for SSH connection.
It's recommended to specify this option in case of multiple networks used for
instance to provide more control over network connectivity.

Please note that `network_ref` relies on Network Services (`Fog::Network`) and
it can be unavailable in your OpenStack installation.


### disable\_ssl\_validation

```yaml
  disable_ssl_validation: true
```

Only disable SSL cert validation if you absolutely know what you are doing,
but are stuck with an OpenStack deployment without valid SSL certs.

## Example

The following could be used in a `.kitchen.yml` or in a `.kitchen.local.yml`
to override default configuration.

```yaml
---
driver:
  name: openstack
  openstack_username: [YOUR OPENSTACK USERNAME]
  openstack_api_key: [YOUR OPENSTACK API KEY] # AKA your OPENSTACK PASSWORD
  openstack_auth_url: [YOUR OPENSTACK AUTH URL]
  require_chef_omnibus: [e.g. 'true' or a version number if you need Chef]
  image_ref: [SERVER IMAGE ID]
  flavor_ref: [SERVER FLAVOR ID]

transport:
  ssh_key: /path/to/id_rsa  # probably the same as private_key_path
  connection_timeout: 10
  connection_retries: 5
  username: ubuntu
  password: mysecreatpassword

platforms:

  - name: ubuntu-15.04
  - name: centos-7
    transport:
      username: centos
  - name: windows-2012r2
    transport:
      password: myadministratorpassword

suites:
# ...
```
